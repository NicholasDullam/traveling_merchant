# Traveling Merchant
### What is this?
A hub for any sales gone virtual, Traveling Merchant was a virtual resale platform geared at handling trading logistics and payment options for the gaming industry. As a semester project under CS 307, our team built our web app under the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with the inclusion of Socket.io for handling our messaging and notifications API, and Stripe for payment processing and merchant verification.
